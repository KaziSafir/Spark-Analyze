# Spark-Analyze
The code sets up a Spark environment, reads a CSV file into a DataFrame, performs some data analysis (descriptive statistics, skewness, kurtosis), and creates a histogram of blood pressure data. It also manages Spark sessions and contexts to handle large datasets efficiently.

# Part 1: Setup
Installs necessary libraries and configures Java for Spark.

# Part 2: Data Loading
Reads the diabetes.csv file into a Spark DataFrame.

# Part 3: Exploration
Displays the first 8 rows of the DataFrame, prints its schema, and calculates descriptive statistics for key columns like Glucose, blood pressure, and BMI.

# Part 4: Analysis
Computes the skewness and kurtosis for the Glucose and blood pressure columns.

# Part 5: Visualization
Creates and displays a histogram of the blood pressure data.

The code efficiently handles large datasets by managing Spark sessions and contexts.
